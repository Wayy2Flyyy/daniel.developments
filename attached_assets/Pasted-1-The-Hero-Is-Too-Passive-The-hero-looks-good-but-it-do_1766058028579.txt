1. The Hero Is Too Passive

The hero looks good, but it does not pull hard enough.

Problem:
The headline is clear but emotionally flat. It explains value, but it doesn’t compel action in the first 5 seconds.

Fix:
Add urgency or authority directly under the headline. For example:

“Used by serious developers shipping real products.”

“Built for production. Trusted in live environments.”

This reframes you from “script seller” to professional infrastructure provider.

2. Weak Primary Call to Action

“Browse Products” is safe — too safe.

Problem:
It doesn’t feel like the obvious next step. It feels optional.

Fix:
Replace with a more decisive action:

“View Production Scripts”

“Explore Live-Ready Tools”

“Browse Verified Scripts”

Words like verified, production, live-ready trigger trust and seriousness.

3. No Instant Differentiation

Right now, users understand what you sell, but not why you over others within 8 seconds.

Problem:
There is no fast comparison anchor.

Fix (high impact):
Add a single comparison line under the CTA:

“Not templates. Not experiments. Production-tested code.”

This immediately separates you from low-quality marketplaces.

4. Product Cards Are Informational, Not Persuasive

The cards are clean, but they read like a list — not a solution.

Problem:
Users skim titles and prices, but don’t instantly feel need.

Fix:
Add one bold outcome line per card:

“Eliminates manual moderation”

“Deploy in under 5 minutes”

“Cuts admin setup time by 80%”

Outcome > features. Always.

5. Too Much Content Before Emotional Lock-In

You show competence early, but emotional attachment comes late.

Problem:
“Selected Works” appears after product overload. Emotion should come earlier.

Fix:
Move one strong featured project or testimonial higher up:

A single large case study

Or one sharp quote from a real user

This creates social proof before decision fatigue.

6. The Brand Voice Is Slightly Generic

The design is premium, but the language plays it safe.

Problem:
Safe language does not stick in memory.

Fix:
Lean into confidence. Example:

Replace “Premium FiveM resources…” with
“Serious tools for serious FiveM servers.”

Confidence increases perceived value.

One High-Level Strategic Suggestion (Important)

Right now, your site feels like a high-quality store.
It should feel like a standard setter.

To do that:

Introduce a “Quality Guarantee” concept

Or a “Production-Ready Standard” badge

Or a short manifesto: Why low-quality scripts break servers

This positions you as an authority, not a vendor.

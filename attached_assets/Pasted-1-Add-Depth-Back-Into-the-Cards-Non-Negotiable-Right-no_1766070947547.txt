1. Add Depth Back Into the Cards (Non-Negotiable)

Right now cards are flat blocks.

Fix:

Add a soft radial gradient inside each card
Example:
Dark base → slightly lighter top-left corner

Add a very subtle inner glow (1px, low opacity)

This creates depth without clutter.

Result: Cards feel touchable, not static.

2. Reintroduce Accent Color — But With Discipline

You removed too much color.

Do NOT re-add rainbow themes.
DO use accent color intentionally.

Exact rules:

Product title: white

Outcome sentence: muted gray

Accent color used ONLY for:

“Production-Ready” badge

Arrow icon in “View →”

Hover border glow

That’s it.

This keeps it calm but alive.

3. Upgrade the Section Headers (Major Lift)

“CORE SYSTEMS” and “UTILITIES & TOOLS” are too plain.

Fix:

Increase font size slightly

Add a thin horizontal divider line beneath

Add a subtle gradient fade on the divider

Optional microcopy below header:

Mission-critical systems for live servers
Lightweight tools that solve specific problems

Now sections feel intentional, not just grouped.

4. Cards Need a Clear Hover Moment

Right now hover feels minimal to the point of invisible.

On hover, add:

Border glow (accent color, very low opacity)

Slight background lift (2–4%)

Arrow icon animates right by 2–3px

No scaling. No bouncing. Just confidence.

Hover should say:

“Yes, this is interactive.”

5. Brighten the Grid With Spacing, Not Color

You don’t need lighter colors — you need air.

Exact changes:

Increase vertical gap between rows by ~20%

Increase internal padding inside cards

Slightly widen the grid container

This makes the section feel less compressed and more premium.

6. Add a Subtle “Featured Weight” Without Rebuilding

Your core systems should visually dominate.

Do this:

Make Core System cards:

Slightly taller

Slightly thicker border

Slightly stronger glow on hover

Not bigger text — bigger presence.

The user should feel these are important before reading.

7. Add a Visual Anchor Above the Grid

Right now the section starts cold.

Add one line under “All Products”:

Every product below is actively used in live environments.

Then add a thin accent underline beneath that line.

This warms the section immediately.

8. Improve Icon Treatment (Small Change, Big Effect)

Icons are currently too quiet.

Fix:

Add a faint circular background behind icons

Slight gradient or glass effect

Keep opacity low

This ties back to your glassy / premium theme elsewhere.

What NOT to Do (Important)

Do not add more text

Do not add feature lists

Do not add more colors

Do not reintroduce “Add to cart”

Do not increase contrast aggressively

Terminal Cart — Empty State
What Works

“Terminal Cart” naming is strong. It fits your brand and feels technical.

Clean empty state. No clutter. No confusion.

“Initialize Transaction” is thematically correct.

Problem

The empty state feels dead, not intentional.

Users subconsciously interpret emptiness as “unfinished” unless guided.

Fix (High Impact)

Add one contextual reassurance line:

“Secure session will be created when you proceed.”

This reframes the emptiness as a security choice, not a lack of content.

Cart With Item — Strong Structure, Missing Pressure
What Works

Item layout is clean and readable.

Quantity control is clear.

Total amount is visually anchored.

Stripe encryption callout is excellent.

Problems
1. Weak urgency

Nothing pushes the user forward psychologically.

2. Checkout button is visually strong but emotionally neutral

“Proceed to Checkout” is safe, but safe language invites delay.

Fixes

Replace button copy with:

“Secure Checkout”

or “Continue to Secure Payment”

Security language reduces abandonment more than speed language.

Add a micro-line above the button:

“Instant access after payment.”

This kills the “what happens next?” hesitation.

Payment Page — Clean, Trustworthy, Slightly Sterile
What Works

Minimal fields. Excellent.

Stripe reassurance line is critical and well placed.

Large “Pay Now” button is correct.

Problems
1. No emotional anchoring

This is the most anxious moment for the user, and the UI does nothing to reassure emotionally.

2. No reminder of what they’re buying

Users hesitate when the product disappears from view.

Fixes (Very Important)

Add a subtle confirmation line under TOTAL DUE:

“Anti-Cheat Core (Lua) — Lifetime Access”

This reconnects value at the decision moment.

Change “Pay Now” to:

“Complete Secure Purchase”

or “Pay Securely”

“Pay Now” feels transactional. “Secure Purchase” feels safer.

Trust Signaling — Almost There

You mention Stripe encryption, which is good.

But you’re missing one last psychological lock.

Add one of the following below the button:

“No recurring charges.”

“One-time payment. Lifetime updates.”

“Refunds available within X days.”

Clarity reduces fear more than guarantees.

One Strategic Improvement (High-Level)

Right now, this feels like a payment form.

You want it to feel like a controlled transaction environment.

Recommendation

Add a very subtle terminal-style status line:

STATUS: SECURE_SESSION_ACTIVE

This reinforces your “Terminal” concept and gives the user the feeling of being inside a protected system.

That feeling increases completion.

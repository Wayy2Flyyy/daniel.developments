1. Kill Visual Noise at the Top (Immediate Win)
Current problem

“All Products” header + filters + pills + badges = clutter before value.

The top bar feels like a control panel, not a curated catalog.

Exact changes

Reduce the header height by 30–40%

Remove background fill from the header bar

Keep only:

All Products (left)

Filter button (right)

Move category pills below the header, not inside it.

2. Rebuild Card Layout (This Fixes 70% of the Weirdness)
Current card issues

Too many layers

Badge overload

Feature text density too high

Price competes with everything else

Replace EVERY card with this structure (exact order):

Icon (top-left, muted)

Product name (strong weight)

Single outcome sentence (max 12 words)

Price (quiet, bottom-left)

Primary action (bottom-right)

Nothing else.
No bullet lists.
No stacked badges.

3. Remove Most Badges (Be Ruthless)
Exact rule

Only one badge type allowed across the entire grid

Keep:
Production-Ready

Remove entirely:

Free

Verified

Optimized

Featured (use layout instead)

Free products show $0 — that’s enough.

4. Change Grid Density (Critical)
Exact values

Desktop: 3 cards per row

Tablet: 2 cards

Mobile: 1 card

Increase:

Vertical card padding by 20%

Gap between rows by 30%

This single change will instantly make it feel premium.

5. Introduce Visual Hierarchy Using Size (Not Color)
Featured products (Top 3)

Use wider cards

Span 2 columns

Slightly larger title font

More internal padding

These should be:

Anti-Cheat Core

Economy Core

Admin Panel / Core system

Everything else stays standard size.

This tells the user what matters without saying it.

6. Fix Typography (Very Important)
Current issue

Text blends together.

Exact typography rules

Product name: Semibold / Bold

Outcome sentence: Regular, lower contrast

Price: Medium weight, smallest size

Buttons: Consistent size everywhere

Increase line height on descriptions slightly (1.4–1.5).

7. Button Behavior (Subtle but Powerful)
Replace

Add +

With

View →

This changes the mental model from shopping cart to evaluation, which is what users are actually doing.

Add to cart belongs on the product page, not the grid.

8. Categorization Without Clutter

Instead of pills everywhere:

Add section headers:

Core Systems

Utilities

Assets

Each section:

3–6 products max

White space above and below

Scrolling should feel like chapters, not a wall.

9. Color Discipline
Current issue

Too many accent colors compete.

Exact fix

One accent color for actions

One neutral for icons

No per-card color themes

Color should signal interaction, not classification.

10. Final Psychological Touch (Do This)

Add a single line above the grid:

“Every product below is tested in live environments.”

This reassures users before they even scan.

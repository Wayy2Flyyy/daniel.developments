The Core Problem (Why This Feels Weak)

Right now this modal:

Repeats information already seen in the grid

Talks about the product instead of showing its contents

Feels like marketing, not tooling

Does not justify the click

For dev-focused products, users want to answer ONE question immediately:

“What exactly do I get when I download this?”

Not “features”.
Not “status”.
Files. Structure. Purpose. Guarantees.

The Correct Mental Model

This should feel like:

A README.md

A release package overview

A technical product sheet

Not a popup shop card.

Exact New Structure (Follow This Order)
1. Header: Identity + Context (Stronger Than Now)

Replace the soft header with a technical header block.

Left side

Product name

Category path
Assets → Stream Deck → Icons

Right side

Version: v1.2.0

Last updated: 12 Jan 2025

Status badge: Production-Ready

This immediately makes it feel maintained, not static.

2. “What You Get” Section (This Is Critical)

This should be the first real section, not description text.

Use a monospace-style file tree

Example (this is the level of detail you want):

/stream-deck-icons-pack/
├── README.md
├── LICENSE.txt
├── icons/
│   ├── system/
│   │   ├── start.png
│   │   ├── stop.png
│   │   └── restart.png
│   ├── moderation/
│   │   ├── ban.svg
│   │   ├── mute.svg
│   │   └── kick.svg
│   ├── developer/
│   │   ├── deploy.svg
│   │   ├── logs.svg
│   │   └── terminal.svg
│   └── misc/
├── psd/
│   └── editable-icons.psd
└── previews/
    └── streamdeck-layout.png


This single section alone will:

Kill the “AI-made” feel

Instantly justify the price

Speak directly to developers

3. File-Level Explanations (Rare, Powerful)

Under the tree, add explanations, not fluff.

Example:

README.md
Setup instructions, import steps, icon usage guidelines.

LICENSE.txt
Commercial + personal usage rights.

PSD Source
Fully layered, editable master icons for customization.

This tells users you actually ship real packages, not assets slapped together.

4. Use-Case Mapping (Very Important)

Add a section called Designed For.

Example:

Server admins managing live environments

Developers running Stream Deck workflows

Moderation and deployment shortcuts

Automated server control panels

This ties files → real-world usage.

5. Technical Specs (Dev-Friendly, Not Marketing)

Create a compact grid:

Total icons: 200+

Formats: PNG, SVG

Resolution: 72x72, 144x144

Color modes: Dark / Light

Editable source: Yes (PSD)

Stream Deck ready: Yes

This replaces vague “key features”.

6. Preview With Purpose (Not Decoration)

Instead of generic imagery, show:

Actual Stream Deck layout

Labeled icon groups

Dark vs light comparison

Add captions like:

“Moderation icons mapped to Stream Deck XL”

Captions = intent.

7. Support & Updates Section (Trust Builder)

This should exist in every product modal.

Example:

Documentation included

Discord support access

Free updates for this version

Bug fixes & icon additions tracked

Now it feels like software, not a download.

8. Pricing & CTA — Move It Down

Do NOT keep the price at the top.

Move it to the bottom after all context.

When users scroll down to price, they should already think:

“Yeah, that’s fair.”

Add microcopy under the button:

Instant download • No DRM • Lifetime access

9. Replace “Close” With Intentional Actions

Buttons should be:

Back to products

Add to cart

“Close” feels dismissive and generic.

Visual Detail Changes (Small but Important)

Use monospace font for file trees and specs

Add subtle dividers between sections

Slight accent glow on section headers

Animate section reveal on scroll (very subtle)

These details scream handcrafted.

Brutal Truth

Right now your modal says:

“Here’s a product.”

What you want it to say:

“Here is the exact package you will download and use.”

That shift alone removes the AI/template vibe.

Right now:

It looks safe ✔️

It works ✔️

But it does not feel powerful

Users should feel:

“I’m in control of my account and nothing sketchy can happen here.”

That feeling comes from hierarchy, contrast, and intent-driven actions.

2. Global Visual Improvements (High Impact)
A. Introduce a Clear “Security Zone” Feel

Your page needs stronger containment.

Do this:

Add a subtle outer container glow or border around the main content

Use a slightly lighter background inside cards than the page background

Increase vertical spacing between sections (less cramped = more control)

Think: dashboard, not form page.

3. Account Header — Make It Commanding
Current Issue

The account header is informational but passive.

Improve It Like This

Make the profile section visually dominant

Increase avatar size slightly

Add a verified / unverified badge inline

Example copy structure:

Daniel

danoodile@gmail.com

STATUS: ACTIVE (green dot)

EMAIL: UNVERIFIED (amber dot + action)

Critical improvement:
Turn “Email Verified: Not yet” into an action, not a label.

Button:

Verify Email →
Small, non-primary, but visible.

4. Account Status Section — Add Meaning

Right now “Active” doesn’t mean anything to users.

Improve with context:

Under “Account Status: Active” add:

“Your account has full access to purchases and downloads.”

This removes ambiguity and reinforces value.

5. Active Sessions — This Should Feel Elite

This is your strongest section conceptually. It just needs authority.

Visual Improvements

Give “This device” a stronger highlight

Use a subtle accent color glow

Make “Current” a badge, not inline text

Information Improvements

Add:

Browser icon (Chrome, Edge, etc.)

OS icon (Windows/macOS)

Location (approximate, city-level)

This screams security maturity.

Logout Everywhere Button

Good idea, but visually too soft.

Change:

Keep red

Increase padding

Add warning tooltip:

“Immediately ends all active sessions.”

Fear + clarity = trust.

6. Quick Actions — Rename and Reframe

“Quick Actions” sounds generic.

Rename It To:

Account Actions or Session Controls

Improve Layout

Separate neutral actions from destructive ones

“Browse Products” → neutral

“Sign out” → destructive

Add microcopy under Sign out:

“Ends the current session only.”

This avoids user hesitation.

7. Add a Missing Section (Very Important)
Add: Security Summary

This is where the page becomes premium.

A small card with:

Email verification status

Password last changed

MFA status (even if not enabled yet)

Example:

Email: ❌ Unverified

Password: ✅ Set

MFA: ❌ Disabled → Enable

This nudges best behavior without forcing it.

8. Microcopy Tweaks That Matter

Replace passive language:

“Not yet” → “Unverified”

“Logout everywhere” → “Sign out of all devices”

“This device” → “Current session”

These feel more deliberate and professional.

9. Psychological Win (Subtle but Powerful)

Add one line at the bottom of the page:

“Security events are logged and monitored.”

You don’t even need logs yet.
This line alone increases perceived protection.

Final Result If You Apply This

Feels like a secure control panel

Signals serious backend infrastructure

Reduces anxiety

Increases trust to proceed to checkout/downloads

Matches your “production-ready” brand promise
